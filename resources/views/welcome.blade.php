                Frogs and other amphibians are under pressure. Nearly one-third of the worldâ€™s amphibians are threatened or extinct, according to a report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Habitat loss is perhaps the biggest contributor to these declines. The spread of a fungus called chytrid (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) has also taken a toll, leading to the catastrophic decline or extinction of at least 200 species. At our request, the amphibian specialists at the IUCN put together a list of five frogs that face the greatest risk of extinction. You can catch a glimpse of one of these rare animals, the Titicaca Water Frog, in the upcoming Nature episode Fabulous Frogs.
